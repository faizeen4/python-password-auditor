# Features
- Entropy-based password strength calculation
- Common password & dictionary checks
- Pattern detection (repeated, sequential, dates)
- Strength scoring and detailed feedback
- Command-line interface (CLI)

# How It Works
- Calculates password entropy using Shannon entropy
- Checks passwords against a common password list
- Detects weak patterns using regular expressions
- Assigns a strength score (0–100)

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/faizeen4/python-password-auditor.git
cd python-password-auditor
